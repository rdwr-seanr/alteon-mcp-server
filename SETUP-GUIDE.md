# Step-by-Step Guide: Setting up Alteon MCP with LM Studio

## Overview
You now have a working MCP server that can communicate with your Alteon device! Here's how to integrate it with LM Studio.

## Step 1: Verify Your MCP Server Works
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Your MCP server is built and tested successfully!

The test showed:
- MCP server starts correctly
- Tools are properly defined
- Connection to Alteon 10.210.240.23 works
- DNS configuration data is retrieved successfully
- **FIXED**: Port decoding now shows readable port numbers (e.g., Port 2, Port 3)
- **FIXED**: Interface stats now work using PortInfoTable API

## Step 2: Configure LM Studio

### Option A: Using LM Studio's MCP Settings (Recommended)
1. Open LM Studio
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **MCP** (if available in your version)
3. Add a new MCP server with these settings:
   - **Name**: `alteon`
   - **Command**: `node`
   - **Arguments**: `["C:\\Users\\SeanR\\Documents\\small-alteon-mcp\\alteon-mcp-server\\dist\\index.js"]`
   - **Working Directory**: `C:\\Users\\SeanR\\Documents\\small-alteon-mcp\\alteon-mcp-server`

### Option B: Using Configuration File
1. Create or edit LM Studio's MCP configuration file
2. The file is usually located at: `%APPDATA%\\LMStudio\\mcp_config.json`
3. Copy the content from our `lm-studio-config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alteon": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "C:\\Users\\SeanR\\Documents\\small-alteon-mcp\\alteon-mcp-server\\dist\\index.js"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Restart LM Studio
After adding the MCP configuration, restart LM Studio completely.

## Step 4: Test with AI Chat
Once LM Studio is restarted, start a new chat and try these example prompts:

### Example 1: System Information
```
"Can you get the system information from my Alteon device at 10.210.240.23? 
Username is admin, password is admin"
```

### Example 2: DNS Configuration
```
"What's the DNS configuration on my Alteon at 10.210.240.23? 
Use admin/admin for credentials"
```

### Example 3: VLAN Information (Now with readable ports!)
```
"Show me the VLAN table from my Alteon device 10.210.240.23 
with admin credentials"
```

### Example 4: Interface Status (Now working!)
```
"Get the interface configuration from my Alteon at 10.210.240.23"
```

## Step 5: Understanding the Results

When you ask these questions, the AI will:
1. Recognize you're asking about Alteon device information
2. Use the appropriate MCP tool automatically
3. Make the REST API call to your device
4. Format and present the results in a readable way

## Available Tools

Your MCP server provides these tools:

1. **get_system_info** - Basic system information
2. **get_vlan_table** - VLAN configuration with **decoded port numbers**
3. **get_dns_config** - DNS client settings
4. **get_interface_stats** - Interface configuration with **readable status and speeds**

## Troubleshooting

### If MCP server doesn't appear in LM Studio:
1. Check LM Studio version supports MCP
2. Verify the file path in configuration is correct
3. Ensure Node.js is in your system PATH
4. Check LM Studio logs for error messages

### If connection to Alteon fails:
1. Verify Alteon IP is reachable: `ping 10.210.240.23`
2. Check if REST API is enabled on Alteon
3. Verify username/password credentials
4. Check firewall settings

### If getting empty responses:
- Some system information OIDs might not be available on your Alteon version
- âœ… **FIXED**: VLAN ports now show as readable numbers instead of hex bitmasks
- âœ… **FIXED**: Interface stats now use the correct PortInfoTable API
- Try the DNS and VLAN tools which we know work with your device

## Security Notes

- This example disables SSL verification for lab environments
- For production, configure proper SSL certificates
- Consider using environment variables for credentials
- The MCP server runs locally and only you can access it

## Learning MCP Architecture

This simple MCP server demonstrates:

1. **Tool Definition**: How to define what tools are available
2. **Parameter Handling**: How to accept and validate input parameters  
3. **External API Calls**: How to make HTTP requests to external systems
4. **Response Formatting**: How to return data to the AI assistant
5. **Error Handling**: How to handle network and API errors

The AI assistant automatically:
- Selects the right tool based on your question
- Passes the correct parameters
- Formats the response in human-readable form

## Next Steps

Once this is working, you can:
1. Add more Alteon API endpoints
2. Create more sophisticated queries
3. Add configuration change capabilities (with proper safeguards)
4. Extend to support multiple Alteon devices
5. Add monitoring and alerting features

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- LM Studio shows the MCP server as connected
- The AI can answer questions about your Alteon
- You see real data from your device (like the DNS config we tested)
- The AI uses natural language to explain the technical data

Congratulations! You've built and deployed your first MCP server! ðŸŽ‰
